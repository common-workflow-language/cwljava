/**
 * Auto-generated interface for <I>https://w3id.org/cwl/cwl#Directory</I><br>
 * This interface is implemented by {@link DirectoryImpl}<br>
 *
 * <BLOCKQUOTE>
 *
 * Represents a directory to present to a command line tool.
 *
 * <p>Directories are represented as objects with `class` of `Directory`. Directory objects have a
 * number of properties that provide metadata about the directory.
 *
 * <p>The `location` property of a Directory is a URI that uniquely identifies the directory.
 * Implementations must support the file:// URI scheme and may support other schemes such as
 * http://. Alternately to `location`, implementations must also accept the `path` property on
 * Directory, which must be a filesystem path available on the same host as the CWL runner (for
 * inputs) or the runtime environment of a command line tool execution (for command line tool
 * outputs).
 *
 * <p>A Directory object may have a `listing` field. This is a list of File and Directory objects
 * that are contained in the Directory. For each entry in `listing`, the `basename` property defines
 * the name of the File or Subdirectory when staged to disk. If `listing` is not provided, the
 * implementation must have some way of fetching the Directory listing at runtime based on the
 * `location` field.
 *
 * <p>If a Directory does not have `location`, it is a Directory literal. A Directory literal must
 * provide `listing`. Directory literals must be created on disk at runtime as needed.
 *
 * <p>The resources in a Directory literal do not need to have any implied relationship in their
 * `location`. For example, a Directory listing may contain two files located on different hosts. It
 * is the responsibility of the runtime to ensure that those files are staged to disk appropriately.
 * Secondary files associated with files in `listing` must also be staged to the same Directory.
 *
 * <p>When executing a CommandLineTool, Directories must be recursively staged first and have local
 * values of `path` assigend.
 *
 * <p>Directory objects in CommandLineTool output must provide either a `location` URI or a `path`
 * property in the context of the tool execution runtime (local to the compute node, or within the
 * executing container).
 *
 * <p>An ExpressionTool may forward file references from input to output by using the same value for
 * `location`.
 *
 * <p>Name conflicts (the same `basename` appearing multiple times in `listing` or in any entry in
 * `secondaryFiles` in the listing) is a fatal error.
