/**
* Auto-generated interface for <I>https://w3id.org/cwl/cwl#ResourceRequirement</I><BR>This interface is implemented by {@link ResourceRequirementImpl}<BR> <BLOCKQUOTE>
 Specify basic hardware resource requirements.
 
 "min" is the minimum amount of a resource that must be reserved to
 schedule a job. If "min" cannot be satisfied, the job should not
 be run.
 
 "max" is the maximum amount of a resource that the job shall be
 allocated. If a node has sufficient resources, multiple jobs may
 be scheduled on a single node provided each job's "max" resource
 requirements are met. If a job attempts to exceed its resource
 allocation, an implementation may deny additional resources, which
 may result in job failure.
 
 If both "min" and "max" are specified, an implementation may
 choose to allocate any amount between "min" and "max", with the
 actual allocation provided in the `runtime` object.
 
 If "min" is specified but "max" is not, then "max" == "min"
 If "max" is specified by "min" is not, then "min" == "max".
 
 It is an error if max < min.
 
 It is an error if the value of any of these fields is negative.
 
 If neither "min" nor "max" is specified for a resource, use the default values below.

   * Minimum reserved number of CPU cores (default is 1).
   * 
   * May be a fractional value to indicate to a scheduling
   * algorithm that one core can be allocated to multiple
   * jobs. For example, a value of 0.25 indicates that up to 4
   * jobs may run in parallel on 1 core.  A value of 1.25 means
   * that up to 3 jobs can run on a 4 core system (4/1.25 â‰ˆ 3).
   * 
   * Processes can only share a core allocation if the sum of each
   * of their `ramMax`, `tmpdirMax`, and `outdirMax` requests also
   * do not exceed the capacity of the node.
   * 
   * Processes sharing a core must have the same level of isolation
   * (typically a container or VM) that they would normally have.
   * 
   * The reported number of CPU cores reserved for the process,
   * which is available to expressions on the CommandLineTool as
   * `runtime.cores`, must be a non-zero integer, and may be
   * calculated by rounding up the cores request to the next whole
   * number.
   * 
   * Scheduling systems may allocate fractional CPU resources by
   * setting quotas or scheduling weights.  Scheduling systems that
   * do not support fractional CPUs may round up the request to the
   * next whole number.
