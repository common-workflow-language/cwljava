/**
* Auto-generated interface for <I>https://w3id.org/cwl/cwl#NetworkAccess</I><BR>This interface is implemented by {@link NetworkAccessImpl}<BR> <BLOCKQUOTE>
 Indicate whether a process requires outgoing IPv4/IPv6 network
 access.  Choice of IPv4 or IPv6 is implementation and site
 specific, correct tools must support both.
 
 If `networkAccess` is false or not specified, tools must not
 assume network access, except for localhost (the loopback device).
 
 If `networkAccess` is true, the tool must be able to make outgoing
 connections to network resources.  Resources may be on a private
 subnet or the public Internet.  However, implementations and sites
 may apply their own security policies to restrict what is
 accessible by the tool.
 
 Enabling network access does not imply a publically routable IP
 address or the ability to accept inbound connections.
