/**
* Auto-generated interface for <I>https://w3id.org/cwl/cwl#Directory</I><BR>This interface is implemented by {@link DirectoryImpl}<BR> <BLOCKQUOTE>
 Represents a directory to present to a command line tool.
 
 Directories are represented as objects with `class` of `Directory`.  Directory objects have
 a number of properties that provide metadata about the directory.
 
 The `location` property of a Directory is a URI that uniquely identifies
 the directory.  Implementations must support the file:// URI scheme and may
 support other schemes such as http://.  Alternately to `location`,
 implementations must also accept the `path` property on Directory, which
 must be a filesystem path available on the same host as the CWL runner (for
 inputs) or the runtime environment of a command line tool execution (for
 command line tool outputs).
 
 A Directory object may have a `listing` field.  This is a list of File and
 Directory objects that are contained in the Directory.  For each entry in
 `listing`, the `basename` property defines the name of the File or
 Subdirectory when staged to disk.  If `listing` is not provided, the
 implementation must have some way of fetching the Directory listing at
 runtime based on the `location` field.
 
 If a Directory does not have `location`, it is a Directory literal.  A
 Directory literal must provide `listing`.  Directory literals must be
 created on disk at runtime as needed.
 
 The resources in a Directory literal do not need to have any implied
 relationship in their `location`.  For example, a Directory listing may
 contain two files located on different hosts.  It is the responsibility of
 the runtime to ensure that those files are staged to disk appropriately.
 Secondary files associated with files in `listing` must also be staged to
 the same Directory.
 
 When executing a CommandLineTool, Directories must be recursively staged
 first and have local values of `path` assigned.
 
 Directory objects in CommandLineTool output must provide either a
 `location` URI or a `path` property in the context of the tool execution
 runtime (local to the compute node, or within the executing container).
 
 An ExpressionTool may forward file references from input to output by using
 the same value for `location`.
 
 Name conflicts (the same `basename` appearing multiple times in `listing`
 or in any entry in `secondaryFiles` in the listing) is a fatal error.
