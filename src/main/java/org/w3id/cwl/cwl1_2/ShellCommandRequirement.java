/**
* Auto-generated interface for <I>https://w3id.org/cwl/cwl#ShellCommandRequirement</I><BR>This interface is implemented by {@link ShellCommandRequirementImpl}<BR> <BLOCKQUOTE>
 Modify the behavior of CommandLineTool to generate a single string
 containing a shell command line.  Each item in the `arguments` list must
 be joined into a string separated by single spaces and quoted to prevent
 intepretation by the shell, unless `CommandLineBinding` for that argument
 contains `shellQuote: false`.  If `shellQuote: false` is specified, the
 argument is joined into the command string without quoting, which allows
 the use of shell metacharacters such as `|` for pipes.
