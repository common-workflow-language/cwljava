 Define a file or subdirectory that must be staged to a particular
 place prior to executing the command line tool.  May be the result
 of executing an expression, such as building a configuration file
 from a template.
 
 Usually files are staged within the [designated output directory](#Runtime_environment).
 However, under certain circumstances, files may be staged at
 arbitrary locations, see discussion for `entryname`.

   * a File or Directory, the `entryname` field overrides the value
   * of `basename` of the File or Directory object.

   * * Required when `entry` evaluates to file contents only
   * * Optional when `entry` evaluates to a File or Directory object with a `basename`
   * * Invalid when `entry` evaluates to an array of File or Directory objects.
   * 
   * If `entryname` is a relative path, it specifies a name within
   * the designated output directory.  A relative path starting
   * with `../` or that resolves to location above the designated output directory is an error.
   * 
   * If `entryname` is an absolute path (starts with a slash `/`)
   * it is an error unless the following conditions are met:
   * 
   *   * `DockerRequirement` is present in `requirements`
   *   * The program is will run inside a software container
   *   where, from the perspective of the program, the root
   *   filesystem is not shared with any other user or
   *   running program.
   * 
   * In this case, and the above conditions are met, then
   * `entryname` may specify the absolute path within the container
   * where the file or directory must be placed.

   * `Directory` object, or an array of `File` or `Directory`
