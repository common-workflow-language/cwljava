/**
* Auto-generated interface for <I>https://w3id.org/cwl/cwl#WorkflowStep</I><BR>This interface is implemented by {@link WorkflowStepImpl}<BR> <BLOCKQUOTE>
 A workflow step is an executable element of a workflow.  It specifies the
 underlying process implementation (such as `CommandLineTool` or another
 `Workflow`) in the `run` field and connects the input and output parameters
 of the underlying process to workflow parameters.
 
 # Scatter/gather
 
 To use scatter/gather,
 [ScatterFeatureRequirement](#ScatterFeatureRequirement) must be specified
 in the workflow or workflow step requirements.
 
 A "scatter" operation specifies that the associated workflow step or
 subworkflow should execute separately over a list of input elements.  Each
 job making up a scatter operation is independent and may be executed
 concurrently.
 
 The `scatter` field specifies one or more input parameters which will be
 scattered.  An input parameter may be listed more than once.  The declared
 type of each input parameter is implicitly becomes an array of items of the
 input parameter type.  If a parameter is listed more than once, it becomes
 a nested array.  As a result, upstream parameters which are connected to
 scattered parameters must be arrays.
 
 All output parameter types are also implicitly wrapped in arrays.  Each job
 in the scatter results in an entry in the output array.
 
 If any scattered parameter runtime value is an empty array, all outputs are
 set to empty arrays and no work is done for the step, according to
 applicable scattering rules.
 
 If `scatter` declares more than one input parameter, `scatterMethod`
 describes how to decompose the input into a discrete set of jobs.
 
   * **dotproduct** specifies that each of the input arrays are aligned and one
       element taken from each array to construct each job.  It is an error
       if all input arrays are not the same length.
 
   * **nested_crossproduct** specifies the Cartesian product of the inputs,
       producing a job for every combination of the scattered inputs.  The
       output must be nested arrays for each level of scattering, in the
       order that the input arrays are listed in the `scatter` field.
 
   * **flat_crossproduct** specifies the Cartesian product of the inputs,
       producing a job for every combination of the scattered inputs.  The
       output arrays must be flattened to a single level, but otherwise listed in the
       order that the input arrays are listed in the `scatter` field.
 
 # Conditional execution (Optional)
 
 Conditional execution makes execution of a step conditional on an
 expression.  A step that is not executed is "skipped".  A skipped
 step produces `null` for all output parameters.
 
 The condition is evaluated after `scatter`, using the input object
 of each individual scatter job.  This means over a set of scatter
 jobs, some may be executed and some may be skipped.  When the
 results are gathered, skipped steps must be `null` in the output
 arrays.
 
 The `when` field controls conditional execution.  This is an
 expression that must be evaluated with `inputs` bound to the step
 input object (or individual scatter job), and returns a boolean
 value.  It is an error if this expression returns a value other
 than `true` or `false`.
 
 Conditionals in CWL are an optional feature and are not required
 to be implemented by all consumers of CWL documents.  An
 implementation that does not support conditionals must return a
 fatal error when attempting execute a workflow that uses
 conditional constructs the implementation does not support.
 
 # Subworkflows
 
 To specify a nested workflow as part of a workflow step,
 [SubworkflowFeatureRequirement](#SubworkflowFeatureRequirement) must be
 specified in the workflow or workflow step requirements.
 
 It is a fatal error if a workflow directly or indirectly invokes itself as
 a subworkflow (recursive workflows are not allowed).
