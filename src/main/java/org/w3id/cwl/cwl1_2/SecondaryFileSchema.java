/**
* Auto-generated interface for <I>https://w3id.org/cwl/cwl#SecondaryFileSchema</I><BR>This interface is implemented by {@link SecondaryFileSchemaImpl}<BR> <BLOCKQUOTE>
 Secondary files are specified using the following micro-DSL for secondary files:
 
 * If the value is a string, it is transformed to an object with two fields
   `pattern` and `required`
 * By default, the value of `required` is `null`
   (this indicates default behavior, which may be based on the context)
 * If the value ends with a question mark `?` the question mark is
   stripped off and the value of the field `required` is set to `False`
 * The remaining value is assigned to the field `pattern`
 
 For implementation details and examples, please see
 [this section](SchemaSalad.html#Domain_Specific_Language_for_secondary_files)
 in the Schema Salad specification.

public interface SecondaryFileSchema extends Savable {
  /**
   * Getter for property <I>https://w3id.org/cwl/cwl#SecondaryFileSchema/pattern</I><BR>
   * <BLOCKQUOTE>
   * Provides a pattern or expression specifying files or directories that
   * should be included alongside the primary file.
   * 
   * If the value is an expression, the value of `self` in the
   * expression must be the primary input or output File object to
   * which this binding applies.  The `basename`, `nameroot` and
   * `nameext` fields must be present in `self`.  For
   * `CommandLineTool` inputs the `location` field must also be
   * present.  For `CommandLineTool` outputs the `path` field must
   * also be present.  If secondary files were included on an input
   * File object as part of the Process invocation, they must also
   * be present in `secondaryFiles` on `self`.
   * 
   * The expression must return either: a filename string relative
   * to the path to the primary File, a File or Directory object
   * (`class: File` or `class: Directory`) with either `location`
   * (for inputs) or `path` (for outputs) and `basename` fields
   * set, or an array consisting of strings or File or Directory
   * objects as previously described.
   * 
   * It is legal to use `location` from a File or Directory object
   * passed in as input, including `location` from secondary files
   * on `self`.  If an expression returns a File object with the
   * same `location` but a different `basename` as a secondary file
   * that was passed in, the expression result takes precedence.
   * Setting the basename with an expression this way affects the
   * `path` where the secondary file will be staged to in the
   * CommandLineTool.
   * 
   * The expression may return "null" in which case there is no
   * secondary file from that expression.
   * 
   * To work on non-filename-preserving storage systems, portable
   * tool descriptions should treat `location` as an
   * [opaque identifier](#opaque-strings) and avoid constructing new
   * values from `location`, but should construct relative references
   * using `basename` or `nameroot` instead, or propagate `location`
   * from defined inputs.
   * 
   * If a value in `secondaryFiles` is a string that is not an expression,
   * it specifies that the following pattern should be applied to the path
   * of the primary file to yield a filename relative to the primary File:
   * 
   *   1. If string ends with `?` character, remove the last `?` and mark
   *     the resulting secondary file as optional.
   *   2. If string begins with one or more caret `^` characters, for each
   *     caret, remove the last file extension from the path (the last
   *     period `.` and all following characters).  If there are no file
   *     extensions, the path is unchanged.
   *   3. Append the remainder of the string to the end of the file path.
