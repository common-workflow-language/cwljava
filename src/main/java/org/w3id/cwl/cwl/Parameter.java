   * <p>Provides a pattern or expression specifying files or directories that should be included
   * alongside the primary file. Secondary files may be required or optional. When not explicitly
   * specified, secondary files specified for `inputs` are required and `outputs` are optional. An
   * implementation must include matching Files and Directories in the `secondaryFiles` property of
   * the primary file. These Files and Directories must be transferred and staged alongside the
   * primary file. An implementation may fail workflow execution if a required secondary file does
   * not exist.
   *
   * <p>If the value is an expression, the value of `self` in the expression must be the primary
   * input or output File object to which this binding applies. The `basename`, `nameroot` and
   * `nameext` fields must be present in `self`. For `CommandLineTool` outputs the `path` field must
   * also be present. The expression must return a filename string relative to the path to the
   * primary File, a File or Directory object with either `path` or `location` and `basename` fields
   * set, or an array consisting of strings or File or Directory objects. It is legal to reference
   * an unchanged File or Directory object taken from input as a secondaryFile. The expression may
   * return "null" in which case there is no secondaryFile from that expression.
   *
   * <p>To work on non-filename-preserving storage systems, portable tool descriptions should avoid
   * constructing new values from `location`, but should construct relative references using
   * `basename` or `nameroot` instead.
   *
   * <p>If a value in `secondaryFiles` is a string that is not an expression, it specifies that the
   * following pattern should be applied to the path of the primary file to yield a filename
   * relative to the primary File:
   *
   * <p>1. If string ends with `?` character, remove the last `?` and mark the resulting secondary
   * file as optional. 2. If string begins with one or more caret `^` characters, for each caret,
   * remove the last file extension from the path (the last period `.` and all following
   * characters). If there are no file extensions, the path is unchanged. 3. Append the remainder of
   * the string to the end of the file path. *
